# What & Why
- Wanted to create a starting place in NPM with a minimal & common set of frontend tooling for development purposes. 

# Includes setup for:
- Eslint
- Sass/scss
- Autoprefixer
- Babel
- Postcss
- Webpack
- StyleLint

# To be added
- Pug html templating
- Combine css watch & js watch into one npm command

# You can build and compile the required components with npm
- Watch & Build css on changes: npm run watch:css
- Watch & Build js on changes: npm run watch:js

# No automatic browser refreshing is enforced.
- There are several free tools that support this. For example the live server extension in vscode
